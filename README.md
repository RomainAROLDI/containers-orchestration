# Containers orchestration

## Get started

After cloning the repository, copy the .env.example file to .env and complete it. 
After that, move to the project directory, 
build the images and launch the containers:
`cd containers-orchestration && docker-compose up -d --build`

You can now go to http://localhost to access the API, 
http://localhost/db to access Adminer and http://localhost/public to access the static files server.
